    <p>It has been a while since I graduated from college. Writing is not a habit of mine, even though it was required for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>However, as you may have noticed already, human memory is <em>not reliable</em>, and notes are often more <em>confusing</em> than helpful. I feel the need to write something, for myself but not to myself.</p>

<h2 class="heading" id="in-memory-vs-at-disk">
  In Memory vs. At Disk
  <a class="anchor" href="#in-memory-vs-at-disk">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Though this is common sense, I need to repeat myself: <strong>memory is not reliable and never meant to be</strong>.</p>
<p>I assume it is not just me who has experienced the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the same setup issue every time you boot an application, but you need to find the solution every single time.</li>
<li>You search a question on Google or StackOverflow and find that the link has already been visited.</li>
<li>When your colleague asks you a question, your immediate response is: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve encountered that before. Damn, I don&rsquo;t remember where to find that wiki!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of problem is so prevalent that no one bothers to question whether it has to be like that.</p>
<p>Here are more examples that I have noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>You promised to visit a friend in a few days, but you forget after the conversation.</li>
<li>You say, &ldquo;I know what that is. Let me forward the link to you!&rdquo; However, you never do.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are countless examples I can provide. All of this is to say: <strong>let our memory be memory, and allow it to handle what is important</strong>.</p>
<p>That is why we need a runbook for incidents, FAQs for questions, a calendar for events, and lists for to-dos.</p>
<p>I like one of the paragraphs I shamelessly copied from a Reddit thread:</p>
<pre><code>If I need to be somewhere - that's on my calendar
If I need to remember to do something - that's on my to-do list
If I need to just remember something - it goes in my notes app
</code></pre>
<p>However, why shouldn&rsquo;t we just take notes?</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="notes-or-blogs">
  Notes or Blogs?
  <a class="anchor" href="#notes-or-blogs">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I was a huge fan of note-taking apps. I probably tried 20 different genres of them over the last 8 years. However, a hard lesson for me is: &ldquo;<strong>just taking notes doesn&rsquo;t make me a better programmer.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reason for that is probably that I took notes without reading them. Even when I tried, it didn&rsquo;t work as intended. The notes were taken out of context, and I was not able to review and recall what I had learned before.</p>
<p>The thing that helped me (a bit) is one of the core ideas from &ldquo;How to Take Smart Notes&rdquo;: <strong>write as if it were the final manuscript</strong>.</p>
<p>If you consider when the note may be used, it could be days later, months later, or years later. We are not going to remember what we had in mind at the time the note was taken. Assume yourself as a reader of your notes instead of the author.</p>
<p>That is to say: what we write down should be something readable to an audience without context. That is how I define an article.</p>
